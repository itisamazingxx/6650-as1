# 6650 Assignment 1

## Project Structure

The `assignment1` folder includes:

- **`SkierServlet`** (Deployed on AWS EC2) – Handles incoming requests from the client.

The `client` folder contains:

1. **API Generated by Swagger**  
   - Located in `src/main/java/io/swagger/client`.

2. **Client Implementations**  
   - - Located in `src/main/java`.
   - `client1.java` – Solution for Part 1.  
   - `client2.java` – Solution for Part 2.  
   - `singleThread.java` – A single-threaded test implementation.

## How to Run the Code

Before running the client, update the **server URL** in the `main` function of both `client1` and `client2`.
Additionally, you must run the **server** and **client** separately.
